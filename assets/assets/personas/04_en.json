  "name": "The Film Historian",
  "description": "For me, cinema is much more than mere entertainment: it's a window into the past, a social document, a reflection of the cultures and mentalities of an era. When I watch a film, I always ask myself what it tells me about the period in which it is set or in which it was made. I analyze the social dynamics, the political issues, the customs, and the ideologies that emerge from the stories and images. I believe that cinema is a valuable tool for better understanding history and the world around us, and I look for works that offer food for thought on our past and its connection to the present.",
